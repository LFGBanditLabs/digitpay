DigitPay — Bridging Crypto to Real-World Payments
Project Description

DigitPay is a next-generation payment platform that enables users to convert their cryptocurrency holdings into fiat and seamlessly use them to pay for goods and services in the real world.

By integrating crypto wallets, fiat on/off-ramps, and merchant payment systems, DigitPay removes the friction between digital assets and everyday spending — empowering users to transact globally without worrying about liquidity, volatility, or conversions.

🌍 Key Features
🔄 Crypto-to-Fiat Conversion

Convert supported cryptocurrencies (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDT) into fiat currencies (USD, EUR, NGN, etc.) in real time.

💳 Merchant Payments

Use your crypto balance to pay for goods and services directly through integrated payment gateways or partner merchants.

🪪 User Wallet Integration

Connect popular Web3 wallets like MetaMask, WalletConnect, or Trust Wallet to fund your account or make payments.

🏦 Instant Settlement

Funds are instantly converted and settled in merchants’ fiat accounts, ensuring smooth transactions and stable pricing.

🔐 Security & Compliance

DigitPay uses end-to-end encryption, KYC verification, and smart contract-based escrow to ensure safety and compliance with financial regulations.

💼 Multi-Currency Support

Supports multiple crypto and fiat pairs, enabling global reach and flexible payments.
